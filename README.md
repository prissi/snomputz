AFM/STM viewing and analysing software

This is a program which started on a 386 with 2MB of RAM on Windows 3.11 and no numerical coprocessor in Borland C in Germany. Hence the inconsistent coding style, obsolete (like HUGE pointers), 16 Bit defines, German comments, and no longer support of capturing unless you get hold of a ISA TI DSP ... However, this means also that most operations are lightining fast and program still fits on any USB stick without installation. Download and run it.

Over the zear I added more useful stuff, for me and mz fellow  during my career it was a useful tool for many fellow colleges, as it is small and has some very powerful feature, like the automatic counting of dots (or pits), counting of line defects ("BSF"), surface angular analysis, and fractal dimension.

It supports many formats, a lot of rather exotic ones, like Hitachi (Seiko), 3D holographic surface maps, Hitachi TIFF SEM images, Park/Digital/Vecco, Omicron, and some other exotic ones as well. If you copy the images to PowerPoint, you can ungroup them and remove scales or rearrange positions. I am using it as my sole tool, but it probably works best with another software together.

The help files is still entirely German. I will translate them at some time.

So I hope it is helpful for you too. The software is Freeware.
