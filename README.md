AFM/STM viewing and analysing software

This program started on a 386 with 2MB of RAM on Windows 3.11 and no numerical coprocessor in Borland C in Germany. Hence the inconsistent coding style, obsolete (like HUGE pointers), 16 Bit defines, German comments, and no longer support of capturing unless you get hold of a ISA TI DSP ... However, this means also that most operations are lightining fast and the program still fits on any USB stick without installation. Download and run it.

Over the years I added more useful stuff. It was and still is a useful tool for many fellow collegues, because it is small, portabel (i.e. requires no installation) and has some very powerful feature, great flattening with much less artefacts than other software, or the semi-automatic counting of dots (or pits), counting of line defects ("BSF"), surface angular analysis, fractal dimension etc.

It supports many formats, like Hitachi (Seiko), 3D holographic surface maps, Hitachi TIFF SEM images, Park/Digital/Vecco, Omicron, and some other exotic ones as well. If you copy the images to PowerPoint, you can ungroup the copied image and remove scales or rearrange positions and change font size. Never been able to do this with another program after copying. I am using it as my sole tool for AFM/3D surface maps, but it probably works best with another software together for missing features.

The help files is still entirely in German. I might translate them at some time.

So I hope it is helpful for you too. The software is Freeware.
