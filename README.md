AFM/STM viewing and analysing software

This is a program which started on a 386 with 2MB of RAM and no numerical coprocessor in MS Visual C 4.0 in Germany. Hence the inconsistent coding style, obsolete (like HUGE pointers) and no longer support capturing unless ypu get hold of a ISA TI DSP ...

However, during my career it was a useful tool for many fellow colleges, as it is small and has some very powerful feature, like the automatic counting of dots, surface angular analysis and fractal dimension. It still fits easily on a flaooy disk and does not need any installation.

So use it as you see fits. The software is Freeware.
